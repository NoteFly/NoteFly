                    NoteFly codestyle guidelines

1.  Don't use tabs, use 4 spaces instead.
2.  The default class layout is: datatypes, constructors, properties
    public methodes and then private methodes.
3.  Constants are all uppercase.
4.  Variables are all lowercase.
5.  Properties start with a uppercase letter.
6.  Public methodes start with a uppercase letter.
7.  Project class names start with a uppercase letter.
8.  Use a prefix for gui controls:
    lbl  for a Label
    tb   for a TextBox
    chx  for a CheckBox
    cbx  for a ComboBox
    rtb  for a RicheditTextBox
    pnl  for a Panel
    Frm  for a Form (start with uppercase letter because of point 7)
    btn  for a Button
    num  for a NummericUpDown
    tab  for a TabPage
9.  Every methode needs documentation.
10. Use a constant for a error message before logging and showing it in messagebox,
    these constants can be used to for making translation of NoteFly in the future a easier task.
11. Gui controls that are static, have a additional prefix: Text.
    e.g. a label that displays "Select default note skin:" has the control name: lblTextDefaultNoteSkin
12. All settings of NoteFly are set in Settings.cs.
